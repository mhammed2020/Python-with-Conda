d = {} # empty dict
d = {'key': 'value'} # dict with initial values


# Also unpacking one or multiple dictionaries with the literal syntax is possible
# makes a shallow copy of otherdict
# d = {**otherdict}
# also updates the shallow copy with the contents of the yetanotherdict.
# d = {**otherdict, **yetanotherdict}
